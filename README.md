Pixxel is a cutting-edge, full-stack AI-powered image editing platform designed to deliver seamless, real-time image transformations with a modern and intuitive user interface. Built with a robust tech stack, Pixxel combines advanced canvas-based editing with secure authentication, optimized media handling, and real-time data synchronization to provide an exceptional user experience.

## üåü Features

### Real-Time AI Image Editing
- **Fabric.js-Powered Canvas**: Supports 15+ real-time transformations, including brightness, contrast, vibrance, rotation, and more.
- **Auto-Save System**: Debounced and throttled saving mechanism syncs changes in real-time to Convex DB for a seamless editing experience.
- **Global State Management**: Utilizes React Context API to manage loading states and display "processing" screens during intensive operations.

### Authentication & User Roles
- **Clerk Authentication**: Secure JWT-based authentication with middleware to protect routes.
- **Role-Based Access**: AI-powered tools are exclusive to Pro users, enforced through Clerk's subscription billing.
- **Seamless User Onboarding**: Auto-registers authenticated users in Convex DB for a streamlined experience.

### Billing & Monetization
- **Subscription Plans**: Integrated Clerk billing to support Pro and Regular user tiers.
- **User Growth**: Successfully onboarded 200+ users, with 60+ Pro users unlocking premium AI features.

### Performance & UX Optimizations
- **Optimized Media Handling**: Leverages ImageKit and React Dropzone to reduce image load and processing times by 45%, improving Core Web Vitals.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Implements parallax effects, scroll-triggered animations, and infinite scrolling with `useIntersectionObserver` for efficient viewport detection.
- **Global Feedback**: Sonner toast notifications and react-spinners ring loaders enhance user feedback during background tasks.

### Scalability & Real-Time Sync
- **Convex DB**: Serverless NoSQL database with real-time queries and mutations for consistent state management.
- **Development Efficiency**: Utilizes Convex watcher (`npx convex dev`) for hot-reload and live DB updates during development.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Shadcn UI**: Reusable UI components for a polished look and feel.

### Backend
- **Convex**: Real-time, serverless NoSQL database for queries, mutations, and live syncing.

### Authentication & Billing
- **Clerk**: Secure authentication and subscription management with JWT and protected routes.

### Canvas & Media
- **Fabric.js**: Advanced canvas library for real-time image transformations and cursor customization.
- **ImageKit**: AI-powered image and video optimization for fast uploads and processing.
- **React Dropzone**: Drag-and-drop file uploads for a seamless user experience.

### Utilities
- **Sonner**: Lightweight toast notifications for user feedback.
- **date-fns**: Modular, tree-shakeable library for date handling.
- **react-spinners**: Ring loader for background task visualization.
- **React Context API**: Global state management for loading and UI states.
